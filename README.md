## Abstract
Urban renewal is a significant topic in China's current urban planning research. With the application of big data and information technology, multivariate data analysis can effectively support and enhance urban renewal studies. This study aims to address the common gap in renewal planning from current situation analysis to the planning and implementation of renewal potential assessment. We propose a framework path for scientifically evaluating the renewal potential of central urban areas based on multivariate data and a quantitative model. Utilizing multi-source spatial-temporal data and the entropy-weight TOPSIS method, we assess and analyze the renewal potential. The outcome is a hierarchical map of urban renewal potential with a 100-meter resolution. This work provides a framework, model, and case study for urban renewal potential assessment, offering scientific guidance for urban renewal planning in the central urban areas of megacities.
